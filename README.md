# John Daniel Semine Portfolio

[Demo](https://johndanielsemine.com/)

A website-portfolio to show case myself, the technologies I know and what I'm capable of. The website was designed using Figma and built with Next.js, FlexBox, CSS Grids, framer-motion and more.

## Lessons Learned

My main goal here was to write clean and readable code to build the whole thing. I achieved that by using CSS variables, breaking down large components to smaller components, etc.

## Potential Future Updates

- Add customised SVG animations made with Rive or possibly Adobe After Effects

## Deployment

Deployed with [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com/).
